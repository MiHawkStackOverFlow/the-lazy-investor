  <h1>What Is Cryptocurrency?</h1>
  <div class="crypto-content">
    A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
    Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.
    A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority,
    rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.
